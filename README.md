# xfade

**Seems like the videos now load, but there have been API changes that cause the videos to get out of sync. Working on getting this fixed!**

xfade is an open-source, lightweight website that simultaneously plays two audio or video files and allows seamless audio fading between them. xfade works best on two files that are meant to be faded into each other. An example is available on the splash page of the site.

This website was developed as a personal project, inspired by the in-game music for Nintendo's Fire Emblemâ„¢ series of games. It is written in HTML5 and Javascript, with CSS for styling. xfade is still a work-in-progress and is slowly being updated, but the core functionality for what I originally envisioned has been completed.

If you have any feedback, you can contact me here on Github or through email at alexoshin@gatech.edu.
