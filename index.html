        <H1>Welcome to xfade!</H1>
        <p>xfade is an open-source, lightweight website that simultaneously plays two audio or video files and allows seamless audio fading between them.</p>

        <section id="buttons">
            <button class="button" onclick="window.location.href='./example'">Check out an example!</button>
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <button class="button" onclick="window.location.href='./youtube'">Try it yourself!</button>
        </section>

        <H5>Please note: xfade is still in development! As such, some features may be buggy or not working as intended. You can contact me on github @alexoshin or email me at alexoshin@gatech.edu for any comments or concerns!</H5>
